                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I'm Aaliyah, the creator of Bitty Bites! Nice to meet you!</p>
                    <p>My recipes focus on my Greek and Aboriginal heritage. 
                    On my maternal side I am Greek, my Yiayia coming from central 
                    Greece and my Papou coming from the North. On my paternal side I am
                    Aboriginal, my family comes from Wilman country in the Noongar
                    region.</p>

                    <h4>My Greek Heritage...</h4>
                    <p>All my life I have known about my
                        Greek heritage. I have fond memories
                        of helping my yiayia and great yiayia
                        braid and twist the koulourakia for
                        Easter. When I was younger I would
                        jump around on a chair, (used to reach
                        the kitchen bench), and my great
                        yiayia would shout “tha peseis! tha
                        peseis!”. I thought it was funny at the
                        time, turns out that she was worried, telling
                        me “you are going to fall!”. My great
                        yiayia was born in Greece and lived in
                        a village called Aliveri before moving
                        to Australia. My yiayia was born here
                        in Australia.</p>

                <h4>My Noongar Heritage...</h4>
                    <p> It a bit was later in my early years
                        that I came to understand that I was
                        Aboriginal. I never really paid atten-
                        tion or asked about why I didn’t have
                        a grandma on my paternal side, and
                        why my dad had olive skin despite my
                        grandad having pale skin. I found out
                        that my grandma and grandad di-
                        vorced whilst my dad was still young,
                        and my grandma wasn’t really present
                        in his life after this. This caused my
                        connection to his Noongar heritage
                        to be broken and lost. I never got the
                        chance to meet my grandma, she had
                        sadly passed away just before we had
                        made plans meet her. When she was
                        younger she was sent to the Roelands
                        Mission after her mum passed away
                        and lived there until she finished
                        school.</p>
